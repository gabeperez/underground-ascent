# Underground Ascent

A permadeath platformer where you play as a character trying to reach the surface after being born and raised underground. Each death spawns you at a random location, but you keep your discovered map and upgrades.

## Game Features

- **Procedural Underground World**: Each save file generates a unique interconnected world of rooms across multiple depth layers
- **Permadeath with Persistent Progression**: Death respawns you randomly, but discovered areas and upgrades carry over
- **Exploration Mapping**: Build a mental (and visual) map of the underground network as you explore
- **Upgrade System**: Bank shards to purchase permanent upgrades that persist across deaths
- **Vertical Progression**: Deeper areas are more dangerous but offer better rewards

## Controls

- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move left/right, navigate menus
- **Z** or **Space**: Jump
- **X**: Interact with objects
- **Escape**: Pause game / Return to menu
